# L2K_Code_Quiz_Portal
The quiz portal has 2 modes:
* Examiner - allows a user to construct a quiz by specifying questions which are then stored in localStorage as an array
* Examinee - allows a user to take a stored quiz which is timed. Once this mode is selected the Examiner btton is disabled

The quiz quiz is timed with the total duration being a a factor of how many questions make up the quiz. There is also a timer which displays how long has been spent on a question. Unanswered questions are deemed incorrect but the Submit Answer button must be pressed to advance to the next question.
